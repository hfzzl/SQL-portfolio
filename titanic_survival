-- 1. What is the survival rate for each passenger class? 

SELECT 
  Pclass, 
  COUNT(*) AS total_passengers,  
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS survived,  
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY Pclass 
ORDER BY Pclass; 

-- Passengers in 1st class had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to those in 2nd or 
3rd class.

-- 2. How did survival rates differ between men and women? 
SELECT 
  sex, 
  COUNT(*) AS total_passengers, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY sex 

-- Female passengers had higher chance of survival compared male passengers with survival rate of 
74.20% and 18.89 respectively.

-- 3. Which age group that has the higher survival rate? 
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN CAST(age AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 0 AND 2 THEN 'Baby' 
    WHEN CAST(age AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 3 AND 17 THEN 'Child' 
    WHEN CAST(age AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 18 AND 59 THEN 'Adult' 
    ELSE 'Elderly' 
  END AS age_group, 
  COUNT(*) AS total_passengers, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
WHERE Age IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY age_group; 

-- Babies and children had significantly higher survival rates compared to adults and the elderly. 
Babies had the highest survival rate at 62.50%, followed by children at 51.69%, while adults and 
the elderly faced much lower survival chances at 38.61% and 26.92%, respectively.

-- 4. How many solo travelers survive the incident compared to group travelers?

SELECT 
  CASE  
    WHEN (SibSp + Parch) = 0 THEN 'Solo Traveler' 
    ELSE 'Group Traveler' 
  END AS travel_type,  
  COUNT(*) AS total_passengers,  
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY travel_type; 

-- The analysis of survival rates based on travel type shows that group travelers had a higher survival 
rate of 50.6% compared to solo travelers, with survival rate of 30.4%.

-- 5. Are women from any classes have higher survival rate from men in any classes? 

SELECT 
  Pclass, 
  Sex,  
  COUNT(*) AS total_passengers,  
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS survived, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN Survived = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY Pclass, Sex

-- First-class female passengers had the highest survival rate at 96.8%, while first-class male 
passengers had a much lower rate of 36.9%. In contrast, third-class males had the lowest survival 
rate at 13.5%.
